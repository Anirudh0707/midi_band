MIDI BAND

Welcome to MIDI BAND, a project from TECHNITES, the flagship event of ENGINEER, the annual tech fest
of the National Institute of Technology, Karnataka, India.

Here we present a variety of musical instruments, including an "Air Piano", "Sound Sensor Flute," "Laser Harp,"
"Voice Synthesizer," and "Musical Accelerometer Air Glove."

The instruments are controlled using an Arduino Microcontroller, and designed using a variety of analog sensors
and actuators mounted on tools, all mapped to LED sync for an aesthetically pleasing musical experience.

Processing is done in Python via PySerial wherever possible, to avoid load on the Arduino, a relatively less powerful
computing device. 

Welcome again, and enjoy your musical experience with MIDI Band!
